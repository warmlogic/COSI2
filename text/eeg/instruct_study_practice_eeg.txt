PRACTICE STUDY PHASE

You will see objects on the left and right sides of the screen
surrounded by colored frames.  Each frame will be one of these colors:

Your job is to remember the location of each object and the color of
the frame with which it was paired.

Keep your eyes on the cross in the middle and observe the objects with
your peripheral vision.  Please try to not blink while the objects are
being presented.
