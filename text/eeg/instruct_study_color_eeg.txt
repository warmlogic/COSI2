STUDY PHASE: COLOR

You will see objects surrounded by colored frames.  Each frame will be
one of these colors: study_colors.

Your job is to remember the color of the frame with which each object
was paired.

Keep your eyes on the cross in the middle and observe the objects
without moving your eyes.  Please try to not blink while the objects
are being presented.
