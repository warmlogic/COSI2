Thank you for participating in this psychology experiment.  We are
interested in how people make simple judgments about pictures of
objects and how they subsequently remember the objects.  There are two
phases to the experiment: study and test.

During the study phase, objects will either appear in the center with
colored frames (study_colors), or they will appear on the left and
right sides of the screen without colored frames.  Your job is to
remember the currently relevant dimension for each object (either its
location or its paired color), as you will be asked about it during
the test phase.

It is very important for you to try to avoid all unnecessary motion,
especially eye blinks, while engaged in the study.  Please try to
limit these activities to the break periods.

After each list there will also be a longer break to give the
experimenters some time to readjust the electrodes, and you a chance
to relax.

We will now go through a practice trial with detailed instructions
about the study and test phases of the experiment.
